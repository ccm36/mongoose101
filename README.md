# Mongoose101

Mongoose JS is hands down the most widely used object-relational mapping (ORM) tool to use with the popular NoSQL database, MongoDB. The main advantage of using a NoSQL database is the ability to store documents. Instead of arranging your information into relational tables, you simply pass a JSON document to the database. This eliminates the conversion of data that is necessary every time something is retrieved or stored from the database. However, MongoDB does not offer any kind of schema validation out-of-the-box. Let's say you have a collection of user documents in your database. When you first created the project, you designed your application to expect a phone number property on every user document that contained a `Number` value. Most likely your application would behave exactly as you expect it for a while. But as your project grows and time moves along, it can be difficult to remember how exactly you intended your user objects to look. If you unintentionally wrote a piece of code that created new user documents with a phone number property that contained a `String` value, or even no phone number property at all, MongoDB would accept the document with ease. This can lead to some very hard-to-find bugs in your application. Mongoose is designed to address these issues specifically and makes schema creation and validation a breeze.
